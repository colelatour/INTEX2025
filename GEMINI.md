## Project Overview

This is a student project for the Fall 2025 INTEX course. The goal is to build a web application for a fictional organization called "Ella Rises". The application will be used to manage and view data related to the organization's activities, including participants, events, surveys, milestones, and donations.

The project consists of three main parts:
1.  A data analysis component to investigate a provided dataset and present insights.
2.  A Node.js/Express web application for data management and visualization.
3.  A dashboard to track participant engagement and program effectiveness.

**Technologies:**
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL
*   **Frontend:** EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)
*   **Deployment:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## Building and Running

As the project is not yet implemented, here are the anticipated commands to build, run, and test the application.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js
*   npm (Node Package Manager)
*   PostgreSQL or MySQL

### Installation

```bash
# TODO: Add any project-specific installation instructions here.
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# TODO: Verify the start command once the project is initialized.
npm start
```

### Testing

```bash
# TODO: Add test execution commands once tests are implemented.
npm test
```

## Development Conventions

*   The project should follow standard Node.js development practices.
*   The database schema should be normalized to 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
*   The application must be deployed on AWS and secured with HTTPS.
*   The web application should include user authentication and authorization, with "manager" and "common user" roles.
*   The project will be graded based on the "Fall 2025 INTEX Grading - Master Rubric.pdf" file.
