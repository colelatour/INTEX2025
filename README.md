This project consists of a full front-end and back-end system developed for Ella Rises, a nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring and uplifting young Hispanic women as they pursue higher education and personal growth.

The database was fully normalized, and both the client and server applications were built to ensure accurate data presentation, provide comprehensive CRUD functionality for administrators, and offer meaningful insights into the program’s impact on participants.

Together, these components help make the organization’s mission more accessible by enabling potential donors and sponsors to engage with, support, and contribute to Ella Rises’ ongoing efforts.

All contributors involved in this project have been acknowledged in the credits listed above.
